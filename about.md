# Mission Statement

I'm a software developer who is passionate about software design who believes the only logistical way to build maintainable software is to build great languages and tooling that aid the programmer. Specifically, I believe the best language has a mathematical basis that enforces composibility. The most promising area of mathematics is the implicational fragment of constructive logic. Research in this area is of intense interest to me.

Please reach out to me if your are similarly interested in the intersection between math and language design.
